# 💡 Problem Statement




# 🧠 Knowledge Primer

- A _PolygonID_ Based on the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and cryptography, Polygon ID is a decentralised and permissionless identity framework for web2 and web3 applications. The SSI framework lets individuals own and control their identities.
- Core components in the Polygon ID
  - **Issuer** In our POC, the issuer is <b>[collab.land](https://www.collab.land/)</b>
    - An entity that issues claims to the Holders. 
  - **Verifier** It requests the holder to send proof based on the claims they hold in their wallet. 
    - A _core concept_ is that trust must exist between a verifier and issuer.

# 🚨 Forking this repo

Many people have contacted us asking if they can use this code for their own websites. The answer to that question is usually "yes", with attribution. There are some cases, such as using this code for a business or something that is greater than a personal project, that we may be less comfortable saying yes to. If in doubt, please don't hesitate to ask us.

We value keeping this site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. We spent a non-negligible amount of effort developing, designing, and trying to perfect this iteration of our website, and we are proud of it! All we ask is to not claim this effort as your own.

Refer to this handy [quora post](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-bad-to-copy-other-peoples-code) if you're not sure what to do. Thanks!
